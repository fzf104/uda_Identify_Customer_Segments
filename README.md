# Identify_Customer_Segments

## 1. Motivation

This project is to work with real-life data provided by AZ Direct and Arvato Finance Solution. The data here concerns a company that performs mail-order sales in Germany. Their main question of interest is to identify facets of the population that are most likely to be purchasers of their products for a mailout campaign. My job is to use unsupervised learning techniques to organize the general population into clusters, then use those clusters to see which of them comprise the main user base for the company.
